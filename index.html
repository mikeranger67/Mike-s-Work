    My name is Mike Ludwig.  I live in Wayne, NJ.  I work in Cybersecurity Sales, Marketing and Operations.  I am taking "MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" for my professional development.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is a portfolio of my work from the course.  In the first section of the course, we learned web development including Javascript, HTML and CSS.
    There are three projects that I created in this website: PacMan Factory, Eye Exercise and the Real-Time Bus Tracker.  Links to each website are provided.
