    <p style="font-family: Arial">This is a portfolio of my work from the course MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. In the first section of the course, we learned web development including Javascript, HTML and CSS. There are three projects that I created in this website: Pacman Factory, Eye Exercise and the Real-Time Bus Tracker. Links to each website are provided.
