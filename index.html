        My name is Mike Ludwig. I live in Wayne, NJ.  I work in Cybersecurity Sales, Marketing and Operations.  I am taking "MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" for my professional development.
        <br>
        This is a portfolio of my work from the course MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. In the first section of the course, we learned web development including Javascript, HTML and CSS.  There are three projects that I created in this website: Pacman Factory, Eye Exercise and the Real-Time Bus Tracker. Links to each website are provided.
